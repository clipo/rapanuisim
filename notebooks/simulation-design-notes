Our goal here is to explore how structured network wiring within relatively small populations plays into retaining information within a population. It is our hypothesis that particular configurations of wiring  favor diversity and richness in knowledge while other wirings lead to loss of knowledge. The key part of this is that in cases where populations are finite unless there is "optimal" wiring among communities, the loss of variability will be relative catastrophic - from a genetic as well as cultural perspective. Thus any mechanism that favors retention of variability will have a fitness consequence.

In the case of Rapa Nui (and many island commmunities) we see interesting patterns of interaction whereby communities appear to have been "hyperlocal" in the way they communicate. While islands can be small and traversed in a matter of hours, most people tend to stick to single places and interact with just immediate neighbors. At the same time there is evdience of "island-wide" interaction that appears as shared motifs, practices, genetics and so on. The question for us on Rapa Nui is whether the archaeological patterning we see about local communitites represents the balance of "island-wide" and "local"  - and whether this best fit those small finite and isolated populations.

To do model this scenario we need to do a couple of things. First, we need to create local communities within which indivduals interact in a panmictic fashion. For the purposes of this study, we will ignore possible structure within the local communities and assume that individuals can learn and interact with anyone else in their local group.
